Lidar point estimation on point-cloud data using SLFN.

My project of my internship at ADASTEC Inc. , June-August 2024.

In the other branches I have tried playing with CNN and RNN models, but couldn't get a satisfying result.

--------------------------------
HOW TO RUN:
-----------------------------
Run main.py. Needs a .bag file to read the data from, in the directory. Reads from two ROS1 topics. 



-------------------------
EXTRA:
-------------------------
The current best result is in the directory as a png.

A short report is in the works...
